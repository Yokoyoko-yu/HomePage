      <p>Nice to meet you! I am Yudai Yokota, a senior at Ritsumeikan University, College of Science and Engineering. My hobbies are reading and watching sports. My favorite author is Gregory Kesnajat from the United States. For this reason, I was very disappointed that He did not win the previously announced Akutagawa Prize. My favorite sport is baseball, especially the Hanshin Tigers.
I was also born in Shimane Prefecture. Shimane Prefecture is very rich in nature and I would like to return to my hometown in the future.</p>
